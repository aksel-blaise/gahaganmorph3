# Landmarking Protocol

The landmarking protocol developed for this project represents a substantial methodological advancement when contrasted with those protocols used in previous studies of Gahagan biface morphology [@RN11783;@RN21001]. This protocol represents the continued evolution of a research programme concerned with the development of a rigourous and replicable three-dimensional (3D) landmarking workflow, which simultaneously takes into account the complex design components of individual bifaces. Landmark and semilandmark placement was achieved using a suite of mathematically-defined criteria within reverse-engineering software---_Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2020.0.1 [Build Number: 30])_---modifying the previous configuration to capitalise upon additional design attributes. The result is a landmark and semilandmark constellation that articulates with specific morphological features (plan views, profiles, and cross-sections) that have demonstrated utility in wide-ranging studies of biface and projectile point morphology.

```

The goal of this effort was to increase the precision and rigour of the study by including the Z-dimension to capture those morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting, thought to have been introduced through the practice of bifacial bevelling. This landmarking protocol is the culmination of the iterative design process that began during the previous 2D [@RN11783] and 3D [@RN21001] geometric morphometric analyses. The cross-sections increase the coverage of semilandmarks across mesh topology, providing for greater precision in the analysis of morphology for the whole object, and can be subset as a means of analysing specific features of interest. For instance, might the previously noted morphological differences in plan view [@RN11783;@RN21001] also extend to Gahagan biface profiles and cross-sections? The evolution of this landmarking protocol represents a concerted effort to better comprehend the vagaries of morphological similarities and differences among Gahagan bifaces. While true that some landmarking protocols can be---and often are---recycled as new specimens are added, this particular research programme endeavours to achieve ever-greater accuracy and precision in each subsequent iteration.

## Spline 1

A spline was extracted using the surface geometry of the mesh with the `extract contour curves` command that allows for the detection and extraction of 3D contour curves from high-curvature areas of the mesh. In reverse-engineering, `extract contour curves` is regularly employed as the first step in building the `patch network` used to construct a surface. The extracted feature curve is rendered as a spline, and follows the highest curvature contours around the periphery of the lateral and basal edges, following the highly variable sinuous edge morphology around the entirety of the biface [@RN21001]. The remainder of the landmarking protocol is based upon this spline, which was subsequently split at four mathematically-defined locations [@RN21001].

### Splitting Spline 1

_A few definitions are warranted before proceeding. `Reference geometries` are used in the assistance of creating other features. These include basic geometric entities, such as `planes`, `vectors`, `coordinates`, `points`, and `polygons`. A `reference point` is a virtual point and is used to mark a specific position on a model or in 3D space. A `reference plane` is a virtual plane that has a normal direction and an infinite size. A `reference plane` is not a surface body, and is used to create other features._ 

The characteristic points and tangents developed for this landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff [-@RN11786]. The first landmark (LM 01) is placed at the horizontal tangent on the tip of each Gahagan biface [@RN21001]. The second and third splits (LM 02 and LM 03) occur at points of highest curvature, and LM 02 is always split on the right side of the biface when oriented in 3D space following the alignment output of _auto3dgm_ [@RN21001]. To place the final landmark (LM 04), a linear measurement was used to project a reference point equidistant between LM 02 and LM 03 [@RN21001]. The location of that point was leveraged in placing the reference plane used to cut the spline at the location of LM 04 [@RN21001].

#### Split Spline 1 at location of LM 01

The `horizontal tangent` is calculated by drawing a horizontal line above the tip of each biface using the tangent as a `common constraint`, and the horizontal as the `independent constraint`. To split the 3D spline at the location of the horizontal tangent, a `reference point` was inserted at the location of the `tangent` in the 2D sketch (light blue point; below, left), followed by a `reference plane` (in white; below, left and right) using the `pick point and normal axis` function where the `reference point` (h-tangent) was used as the `pick point`, and the `Right plane` as the `normal axis` (below, left). The 3D spline was then cut at the location where the `reference plane` intersected with the spline (below image, right).

```{r figlm1, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Identify horizontal tangent, insert reference point and reference plane (left). Use reference plane to cut spline at the location of the horizontal tangent (right)."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lm1.png')
```

#### Split Spline 1 at locations of LM 02 and LM 03

The point of highest curvature on either side of the basal edge was calculated using the `curvature function` in the Accuracy Analyser. This function displays the curvature flow as a continuous colour plot across the area of the curve. In this instance, _curvature_ is defined as the amount by which a geometric shape deviates from being flat or straight in the case of a line. The curvature is displayed in different colours according to the local radius, and is calculated in only one direction (U or V) along the curve. Using this tool, the two points of highest curvature were located between the basal and lateral edges on either side of each biface where the local radius measure was largest. The alignment and orientation of each biface was dictated by the _auto3dgm_ output, and the landmarking protocol follows the mesh orientation, where LM 02 was always placed on the right side of the basal edge, and LM03 on the left.

```{r figcurve, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Identify points of hightest curvature (light blue) at left/right intersection of lateral and basal edges."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/splinesplit1.png')
```

#### Split Spline 1 at location of LM 04

One additional landmark (LM 04) was placed at the centre of the base. The location of this landmark was identified by calculating the linear distance between LM2 and LM3, and projecting a `reference point` (ctrl-div; below) equidistant between the two. A `reference plane` was added using the ctrl-div as the pick point, and the `Right plane` as the `normal axis`. The spline was then split at the intersection of the `reference plane` and the basal spline.

```{r figlm4, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Calculate linear distance between LM2 and LM3, insert reference plane coplanar to Right plane equidistant between LM2 and LM3, and use the reference plane to cut the spline."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lm4.png')
```

## New reference geometry

Each of the preceding protocols were used in the previous analysis of Gahagan bifaces [@RN21001], and this section represents the logical evolution of the previous landmarking protocol used to analyze the morphology of these important artifacts. The resulting constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks can be subset to test a wide range of hypotheses associated with the plan and profile views, in addition to specific cross-sections. Each of the cross-sections is also split between LM 01 and LM04, allowing for analyses of bilateral asymmetry. 

### Vector 1, Point 2, and Plane 2

A linear `reference vector` (vector1) was inserted between LM 01 and LM 04, and a `reference point` (ref.pt.2) placed equidistant between the two landmarks along vector1. The Z-coordinates of ref.pt.2 were altered to relocate it 15mm from vector1 in the direction of the Z-axis, while otherwise maintaining its' alignment with vector 1. The `pick point and coplanar` function was used to place a `reference plane` (Plane 2) along vector1 in the direction of ref.pt.2, bisecting the biface along the Z-axis---perpendicular to the lateral edges---between LM 01 and LM 04.

```{r vecptplane, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Vector placed between LM 01 and 04, ref.pt.2 equidistant between the landmarks along the vector, then the Z-coordinates were altered to offset the point 15mm from the vector (left two images). The vector and ref.pt.2 were subsequently used to place a plane coplanar to the vector in the direction of ref.pt.2 using the `pick point and coplanar axis` function (right two images)."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/vecptplane.png')
```

### Planes 3 and 4

Using the same method, a `reference vector` (vector2) was inserted between LM 02 and LM 03, and a `reference point` (ref.pt.3) was placed equidistant between the two landmarks along vector 2. The Z-coordinates of ref.pt.3 were similarly altered to relocate it 15 mm from vector2 in the direction of the Z-axis. The `pick point and coplanar axis` function was used to place a `reference plane` (Plane 3) along vector 2 in the direction of ref.pt.3, bisecting the biface along the X-axis---parallel to the base---between LM 02 and LM 03. A fourth `reference plane` (Plane 4) was subsequently inserted using the `pick point and normal axis` function that yielded a plane at the intersection of LM 01 and vector1. These two planes serve as the basis for the equidistant cross-sections.

```{r plane3.4, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Vector placed between LM 01 and 04, ref.pt.2 equidistant between the landmarks along the vector, then the Z-coordinates were altered to offset the point 15mm from the vector (left two images). The vector and ref.pt.3 were subsequently used to place a plane coplanar to the vector in the direction of ref.pt.3 using the `pick point and coplanar axis` function. Plane 4 was inserted using the `pick point and normal axis` function with vector1 as the normal axis, and LM 01 as the pick point."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/plane3-4.png')
```

## Cross-sections

Ten equidistant cross-sections were inserted between the `reference planes` (Planes 3 and 4) using the `section` function. The resulting cross-sections are split at the points of highest curvature on the lateral edges, and along the mid-line of the point where they intersect with Plane 2.

```{r cross.10, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Ten equidistant cross-sections were inserted between Plane 3 and Plane 4."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/cross.10.png')
```

### Splitting cross-sections (Step 1)

Cross-sections were split at the intersection of the horizontal splines and Plane 2. The resulting reference geometry provides a means of analyzing the contribution of the morphology associated with the projectile's profile, and divides the landmarking configuration into two discrete components (L/R) that can be used in subsequent analyses of bilateral asymmetry.

```{r cut.cross.plane2, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Cross-sections were cut where they intersect with Plane 2, along the mid-line of the projectile between LM 01 and LM 04."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/cut.cross.plane2.png')
```

### Splitting cross-sections (Step 2)

Cross sections were split at points of highest curvature along the lateral edges of the projectile. These semilandmarks contribute to the analysis of the projectile in plan view, but also follow the dynamic 3D contours associated with the sinuous edge.

```{r pt.high.curv.split, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Spline splits (blue dots) along the lateral edges occur at the point of highest curvature. These splits occur at known coordinates used to add the semilandmarks."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pt.high.curv.split.png')
```

## Landmark and semilandmark placement

LMs 01-04 were placed at the locations of spline splits following the same protocol enlisted by the previous study (blue points, below) [@RN21001]. Five equidistant semilandmarks were added between LM 02 and LM 04, and between LM 04 and LM 03. Along the mid-line, semilandmarks were numbered from top to bottom along front and back, then from top to bottom along the right and left lateral edges, using the output alignment dictated by _auto3dgm_. Four additional semilandmarks were placed equidistant between the lateral edge and mid-line on each of the 10 horizontal splines.

```{r figlmslm-all, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Reference geometry and 3D splines with landmarks (blue) and semilandmarks (white) applied."}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lmslm-allplanes.png')
```

The resulting constellation of landmarks and semilandmarks can be parsed and divided to answer wide-ranging morphological questions related to Gahagan bifaces, marking a substantial advancement in the analysis of Gahagan biface morphology.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to Christian S. Hoggard and David K. Thulman for their thoughtful comments and constructive criticisms on an earlier draft of this landmarking protocol. The current iteration of the landmarking protocol was developed using the `digit3DLand` package in R (code available in this repository); however, the capacity to populate a replicable suite of reference geometry across the sample in _Geomagic Design X_ made it a better option for the dynamic design process.
