# Geometric morphometrics

This effort follows recent analyses of Gahagan biface shapes across the southern Caddo area and central Texas [@RN11783;@RN21001], where Gahgagan bifaces were found to differ in shape across the same geography as the Smithport Plain and Hickory Engraved bottles [@RN11801;@RN11782;@RN11716;@RN20697]. The analysis builds upon previous discussions and analyses conducted by Shafer [-@RN3684;-@RN20701;-@RN4924]. A succinct overview of the analytical procedures used for this analysis is provided in the manuscript, and the analytical code provided in this document can be used to reproduce the results exactly.

## Load geomorph and data

```{r load geomorph, setwd, and load data, echo=TRUE}
# load geomorph
#devtools::install_github("geomorphR/geomorph", ref = "Stable", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(geomorph)
library(wesanderson)

## Generalised Procrustes Analysis

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN478] performed in R 4.0.2 [@R] using the `geomorph` library v. 3.3.1 [@RN11530;@RN1774]. Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects [@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN1646;@RN11563]. 

```{r gpa, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Results of generalized Procrustes analysis."}
Y.gpa<-gpagen(coords, PrinAxes = TRUE, print.progress = FALSE)
# plot(Y.gpa)

# 3D GPA plot

```

```{r centsize.box, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Centroid size of Gahagan bifaces by Region 2."}
# geomorph data frame
gdf<-geomorph.data.frame(shape=Y.gpa$coords, size=Y.gpa$Csize, region=qdata$region, region2=qdata$region2) 

# boxplot - region 2 by centroid size
csz<-Y.gpa$Csize # attribute for boxplot
rgn2<-qdata$region2 # attribute for boxplot
# boxplot of SCA-north, SCA-south, and central Texas Gahagan bifaces by centroid size
boxplot(csz~rgn2, 
        names = c("CTX", "SCA-north", "SCA-south"),
        xlab = "Region",
        ylab = "Centroid Size",
        col = wes_palette("Moonrise2"),
        )
```

```{r consensus.config, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Two-dimensional plot of consensus configuration illustrating morphological characteristics associated with axial twisting---middle and right---which were absent from the 2D analysis."}
# plot consensus configuration in 2D to illustrate axial twisting
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(Y.gpa$consensus[,c("Y", "X")], pch=20)
plot(Y.gpa$consensus[,c("Z", "X")], pch=20)
plot(Y.gpa$consensus[,c("Z", "Y")], pch=20)
```

## Principal Components Analysis

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualise shape variation among the bifaces. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh [@RN1731;@RN479]. 

```{r pca, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Results of PCA with central Texas sample in gray squares, southern Caddo area (north) in orange triangles, and southern Caddo area (south) in tan circles."}
# principal components analysis
pca<-gm.prcomp(Y.gpa$coords)
summary(pca)

# set plot parameters to plot by region2
reg2 <- qdata$region2
pch.gps.reg2 <- c(15,17,19)[as.factor(reg2)]
col.gps.reg2 <- wes_palette("Moonrise2")[as.factor(reg2)]
col.hull <- c("#798E87","#C27D38","#CCC591")

# plot pca by region 2
pc.plot1 <- plot(pca, asp = 1,
                  pch = pch.gps.reg2,
                  col = col.gps.reg2)
                  shapeHulls(pc.plot1, 
                             groups = reg2,
                             group.cols = col.hull)
```

```{r pca.2, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Reference shapes include the consensus configuration (gray) and the shape at the extreme of each PC in black. Reference shapes represent the extremes of each axis, and do not articulate with any specimen used in this analysis."}
# plot PCA with warp grids
#knitr::include_graphics('images/pca-warp-ref.png')
```

## Define models

```{r define-models}
# allometry
fit.size <- procD.lm(shape ~ size, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)
# allometry - common allometry, different means -> reg2
fit.sz.reg <- procD.lm(shape ~ size + reg2, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)
# allometry - unique allometries -> reg2
fit.sz.reg2 <- procD.lm(shape ~ size * reg2, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)

# size as a function of group
fit.sizereg2 <- procD.lm(size ~ reg2, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)

# shape as a function of group
fit.shapereg2 <- procD.lm(shape ~ reg2, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)
```

## Allometry

```{r allometry, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# allometry - does shape change with size?
anova(fit.size)

# reg2
anova(fit.sz.reg) # common allometry (reg2)
anova(fit.sz.reg2) # unique allometry (reg2)
anova(fit.sz.reg2, fit.sz.reg2, print.progress = FALSE)

# allometry plots
# regscore (Drake and Klingenberg 2008)
plot(fit.size, type = "regression", reg.type = "RegScore", predictor = log(gdf$size), pch = pch.gps.reg2, col = col.gps.reg2)

# common allometric component (Mitteroecker 2004)
plotAllometry(fit.sz.reg, size = gdf$size, logsz = TRUE, method = "CAC", pch = pch.gps.reg2, col = col.gps.reg2)

# size-shape pca (Mitteroecker 2004)
plotAllometry(fit.size, size = gdf$size, logsz = TRUE, method = "size.shape", pch = pch.gps.reg2, col = col.gps.reg2)

# predline (Adams and Nistri 2010)
plotAllometry(fit.sz.reg2, size = gdf$size, logsz = TRUE, method = "PredLine", pch = pch.gps.reg2, col = col.gps.reg2)
```

```{r allometry.2, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Measures of Gahagan biface morphology as a function of size for bifaces from both regions, where small and large specimens from each region (black spheres) are contrasted with the consensus configuration (gray spheres)."}

```

## Size/Shape ~ Region?

A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719]. To assess whether shape changes with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were also run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. 

```{r region}
# ANOVA: do gahagan biface shapes differ by region2?
anova(fit.shapereg2)
# pairwise comparison of LS means = which differ?
sh.reg2 <- pairwise(fit.shapereg2, groups = qdata$region2)
summary(sh.reg2, confidence = 0.95, test.type = "dist")
# pairwise distance between variances = standardization?
summary(sh.reg2, confidence = 0.95, test.type = "var")

# ANOVA: do gahagan biface sizes differ by region2?
anova(fit.sizereg2)
# pairwise comparison of LS means = which differ?
sz.reg2 <- pairwise(fit.sizereg2, groups = qdata$region2)
summary(sz.reg2, confidence = 0.95, test.type = "dist")
# pairwise distance between variances = standardization?
summary(sz.reg2, confidence = 0.95, test.type = "var")
```

## Morphological disparity

Procrustes variance was used to discriminate between regions and compare the amount of shape variation (morphological disparity) [@RN5703], estimated as the Procrustes variance using residuals of linear model fit [@RN11530]. 

```{r m-disparity, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# morphological disparity: do either of the groups display greater shape variation among individuals relative to the other group?
morphol.disparity(fit.shapereg2, groups = qdata$region2, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)
# morphological disparity: do either of the groups display greater size variation among individuals relative to the other group?
morphol.disparity(fit.sizereg2, groups = qdata$region2, data = gdf, print.progress = FALSE, iter = 9999)
```

## Mean shapes

```{r m-shapes, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#subset landmark coordinates to produce mean shapes for groups
new.coords<-coords.subset(A = Y.gpa$coords, group = qdata$region2)
names(new.coords)
#group shape means
mean<-lapply(new.coords, mshape)
# plot(mean$CTX)
# plot(mean$SCA-north)
# plotRefToTarget(mean$SCA-north,mean$CTX, method="vector",mag=2)

```

```{r m-shapes.2, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean shapes for Gahagan bifaces from the southern Caddo area (left) and central Texas region (center). In the comparison of the two (right), the southern Caddo area is represented by gray spheres, and the central Texas region by linear vectors."}
